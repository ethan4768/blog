## Don’t take our word for it.

I’ve been using Napkin AI to make quick illustrations for ebooks and social media posts. It’s really changed things for me by making it easy to turn complex ideas into flowcharts that everyone understands right away. I can do it all by myself, which saves a lot of time. Love it!

Napkin effortlessly generating ideas, illustrating, and shares them with everyone. The one thing I love the most is it helps me become a better artist by taking visual notes, script and create a product demo. Keep up the good work.

Napkin AI has a super modern and refreshing UI that makes it fun to use. The ‘Sparks’ feature lets me instantly visualize concepts and ideas with graphs and charts integrated right in my text - it’s perfect for explaining things quickly. Napkin has made my work much more organized and enjoyable.

Napkin quickly condenses large/complex blurbs into neat visual diagrams very similar to those I’d draw during initial mentoring sessions with startups. Excited to see how it unfolds!

I use Napkin for my presentations, notes and video content creation. The generative tools, the image generation and the flow diagrams are super handy to use. Plain text notes get converted into illustrative ones in just a few seconds. I highly recommend this tool to all the content creators and educators out there.

Napkin helps you transform your existing text content into visuals like diagrams, charts, scenes, and images. Think of it as having a personal visual expert right at your fingertips, ready to bring your ideas to life.

Yes, Napkin.ai offers a free plan with some limitations on quotas and customization features. While we are in beta, you can enjoy the Pro plan for free!

Napkins can be viewed on mobile. However, we believe that the best Napkin editing experience is on desktop. That's where your text lives and you're easily able to edit visuals using the mouse and keyboard.

You do not need to write prompts to use Napkin. Simply write or paste your text content into Napkin and click \[Spark icon] to generate your visuals.

Napkin is designed to transform text into visuals, so the platform works like a doc editor with native visual generation and visual editing tools. You can write, generate and edit in the same platform.

There are several ways to share your creations:

* Export your selected content as PNG, SVG, or PDF files. We don't support JPEG because PNG is higher quality.
* Export the entire document into a PDF.
* Share a link to your Napkin so your audience can see your text and graphics integrated together.

While team collaboration isn't our primary focus, Napkin.ai still offers robust capabilities:

* Multiple people can edit a Napkin in real-time, fostering dynamic teamwork.
* Commenting is easy and efficient. Use our built-in highlighter to give feedback on text and visuals.

We've integrated Intercom to assist you. Leave us a question or note, and we'll help you get back on track.
