# Does the world need another CRM?

[](#does-the-world-need-another-crm)

We built Twenty for three reasons:

**CRMs are too expensive, and users are trapped.** Companies use locked-in customer data to hike prices. It shouldn't be that way.

**A fresh start is required to build a better experience.** We can learn from past mistakes and craft a cohesive experience inspired by new UX patterns from tools like Notion, Airtable or Linear.

**We believe in Open-source and community.** Hundreds of developers are already building Twenty together. Once we have plugin capabilities, a whole ecosystem will grow around it.
