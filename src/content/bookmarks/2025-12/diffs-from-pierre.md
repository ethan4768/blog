## A diff rendering library

`@pierre/diffs` is an open source diff and code rendering library. It's built on Shiki for syntax highlighting and theming, is super customizable, and comes packed with features. Made with love by [The Pierre Computer Company](https://pierre.computer/).

Currently v1.0.2

## Line selection

Turn on line selection with `enableLineSelection: true`. When enabled, clicking a line number will select that line. Click and drag to select multiple lines, or hold Shift and click to extend your selection. You can also control the selection programmatically. Also selections will elegantly manage the differences between `split` and `unified` views.
